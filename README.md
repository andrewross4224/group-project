## User Story
As a space enthusiast and local Floridan, I want to be able  to see the next upcoming launches (and past launches) at any given time. I also want to input a date so I can see what launch occurred on that particular day.

## Description
We created an application that can be utilized to view upcoming launches and past launches in Cape Canaveral FL and the Kennedy Space Center. Displayed on the webpage are the 3 next launches, along with the 3 most previous launches. There is also an aside that can be used to search any specific date, past or present. Data will be populated that allows the user to see what rocket launched or is launching on that date. Weather is also available to view for each launch, such as rain chance, wind, visibilty etc.

## Usage
Overall look of the app features 3 cards for upcoming launches, 3 cards for past launches, & an aside card for launch search.
